'''REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is a programming environment that allows users to enter commands and have them executed immediately by the computer. 
A REPL typically presents a prompt to the user, indicating that the environment is ready to accept input. 
The user enters a command, which is immediately executed by the computer, and the result is displayed. 
The prompt is then displayed again, and the process repeats.
A REPL is often used for interactive programming and testing code snippets, as it allows the user to quickly try out code and see the results. 
REPLs are available for many programming languages, including Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and many others.
In addition to being used for testing and debugging code, REPLs can also be used for teaching programming, as they allow students to experiment with code and see the results immediately. 
Some online coding platforms also offer REPLs as a way to practice coding skills in a sandboxed environment.'''

# Import the readline module to allow users to input text with arrow keys and line editing capabilities.
import readline

# Define a function that will repeatedly prompt the user for input and evaluate the input. 
# The function should include a loop that continues until the user enters a specific command to exit.
def repl():
    while True:
        user_input = input(">>> ")
        if user_input == "exit":
            break

# Call the repl() function to start the REPL.

'''In this example, the input() function is used to prompt the user for input and the eval() function is used to evaluate the input as Python code. 
The result is then printed to the console.
Note that this is a very basic example of a REPL, and in practice, you may need to add additional features and error handling to make it more robust and user-friendly.'''
